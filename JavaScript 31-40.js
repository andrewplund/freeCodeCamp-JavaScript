//Lesson Thirty Seven - Word Blanks
//Input
/*
const myNoun = "dog";
const myAdjective = "big";
const myVerb = "ran";
const myAdverb = "quickly";

// Only change code below this line
let wordBlanks = "Once there was a " + myNoun + " which was very " + myAdjective + ". ";
wordBlanks += "It " + myVerb + " " + myAdverb + " around the yard.";// Change this line
// Only change code above this line
*/

//~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~CHAT GPT EXPLENATION~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
/*Certainly, you can build the wordBlanks string by concatenating the provided variables as follows:

javascript
Copy code
const myNoun = "dog";
const myAdjective = "big";
const myVerb = "ran";
const myAdverb = "quickly";

// Only change code below this line
const wordBlanks = "Once there was a " + myNoun + " which was very " + myAdjective + ". ";
wordBlanks += "It " + myVerb + " " + myAdverb + " around the yard.";
// Only change code above this line
Now, the wordBlanks variable will hold the following string:

"Once there was a dog which was very big. It ran quickly around the yard."

This code effectively uses the concatenation operator + to build a string by combining the provided variables as instructed, without changing the words assigned to those variables.
